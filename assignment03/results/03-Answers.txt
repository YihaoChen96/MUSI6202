Q3-4
Freq Resolution = 44100 / 22050 = 2Hz/bin, where 44.1k is the sample rate and 22050 is the number of bins

Q3-5
Zero-pad the signal with the same size of the input will increase the number of bins from 22050 to 44100, 
which results in Freq Resolution = 44100/44100 = 1Hz/bin. The resolution gets finer.
