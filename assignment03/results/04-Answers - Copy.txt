Q4-3
In the rectagular-windowed spectrogram, there are many high-frequency components(7.5k+) while there's very little in the one with Hann window applied. 
Besides, the components below 7.5k of the rectagular-windowed spectrogram are less clearly separated as the ones in the hann-windowed version.
This could be because hann window can help reducing spectral leakage.
